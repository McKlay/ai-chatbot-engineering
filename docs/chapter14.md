# Chapter 14: Advanced Model Optimization Techniques

> *"The real magic isn’t in training the model—it’s in making it fast, cheap, and useful."*

You’ve got your model fine-tuned. It responds like a pro. But now comes the hard part: **serving it to real users** without crashing your GPU, melting your cloud bill, or waiting 10 seconds per response.

This chapter covers the art and science of **LLM optimization**—from quantization and distillation to inference accelerators like **vLLM**, **ONNX**, and **TensorRT**. These are the weapons used by companies that need real-time chat at scale, low-latency edge devices, or just a snappy MVP on a tight budget.

## Goals of Model Optimization

| Objective             | Strategy                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Lower memory usage | Quantization (8-bit, 4-bit, GGUF) |
| Smaller model size | Distillation, pruning, LoRA       |
| Faster inference    | ONNX, vLLM, llama.cpp, TensorRT   |
| Cost reduction     | Multi-model inference, batching   |

---

## 1. Quantization: Shrinking Models with Minimal Accuracy Loss

**Quantization** reduces the precision of model weights (e.g., from 32-bit float to 8-bit int), dramatically reducing memory and speeding up inference.

### 🔹 Types of Quantization

| Type  | Description                          | Memory  | Accuracy |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| 8-bit | Good balance for GPUs                | \~50% ↓ | \~98–99% |
| 4-bit | Ideal for QLoRA, edge devices        | \~75% ↓ | \~96–98% |
| GGUF  | Optimized CPU format via `llama.cpp` | \~80% ↓ | \~95–97% |

### Tools

* `bitsandbytes` – easy 8/4-bit loading with Transformers
* `AutoGPTQ` – post-training quantization (e.g., `TheBloke` models)
* `llama.cpp` – for quantized CPU models in `.gguf` format

### Example

```python
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("model-name", quantization_config=bnb_config)
```

## 2. Distillation: Teaching a Small Model to Imitate a Big One

**Distillation** compresses a large “teacher” model (e.g., Mistral-7B) into a smaller “student” model (e.g., DistilGPT2) by training it to mimic the outputs.

| Benefit         | Use Case                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Smaller models  | Mobile, embedded, real-time apps |
| Faster response | Chatbots with tight latency SLAs |
| Cheaper hosting | Serverless or batch APIs         |

Tools: `transformers`, `trl`, or custom KD scripts.

> Example: MiniLM, TinyLLaMA, DistilBERT are all distilled models.

## 3. Pruning: Removing Dead Weights

**Pruning** eliminates neurons, heads, or layers that have minimal impact on performance.

* Reduces FLOPs and memory
* Best used post-fine-tuning
* Works well with distillation

Not widely used in production due to accuracy risk, but helpful in tight environments.

---

## 4. Accelerated Inference Engines

Optimizing how the model **runs**, not just what it knows.

### 🔹 ONNX Runtime

* Converts models to **ONNX format** for hardware-agnostic speedups
* Used for **low-latency APIs**, embedded systems

```bash
optimum-cli export onnx --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 ./onnx_model
```

### 🔹 TensorRT

* NVIDIA’s deep learning inference SDK
* Great for **batching and low-latency** GPU apps

```bash
optimum-cli export tensorrt --model path_to_model ./trt_model
```

### 🔹 vLLM (by LMSYS)

> “Serving LLMs like search engines.”

* FlashAttention 2 support
* Multi-user, multi-turn parallelism
* Hugely reduces context reprocessing

```bash
pip install vllm
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
```

Use this for **high-concurrency chatbots**, especially in production.

### 🔹 llama.cpp / GGUF

* Fast CPU-only inference
* Ideal for **offline or edge**
* Supports WebAssembly, iOS, Windows

## 5. Serving Multiple Models or Sessions

| Feature              | Solution                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Multi-user load      | `vLLM`, `Ray Serve`, `TGI`       |
| Concurrent endpoints | `FastAPI`, `nginx`, `uvicorn`    |
| Chat history caching | Redis, local session state       |
| Model routing        | Router layer + FastAPI endpoints |

You can serve:

* Multiple models (e.g., 7B for normal, 13B for premium)
* Multiple versions (e.g., v1, v2)
* Multiple LoRA adapters loaded at runtime (via `merge_and_unload()`)

## Summary

| Optimization  | When to Use                         | Benefit                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Quantization  | Low-resource or edge deployments    | Lower RAM & cost          |
| Distillation  | Real-time apps, mobile              | Faster + smaller          |
| Pruning       | Research & experimentation          | Smaller model size        |
| ONNX/TensorRT | High-throughput, GPU-optimized APIs | Inference speed           |
| vLLM          | Multi-user chat systems             | Parallelism + performance |
| llama.cpp     | Offline / local / embedded          | Lightweight inference     |
