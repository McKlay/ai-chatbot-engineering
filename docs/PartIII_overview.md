## ðŸŸ¢ Part 3: Hosting Your Own LLM Models (Full Control & Customization)

As chatbot adoption matures, many teams begin to ask a critical question: **Should we host our own models?** This part of the book explores what happens when you move beyond OpenAIâ€™s playground and take the reins of your own large language model (LLM infrastructure). Whether for **data privacy**, **cost control**, or **performance tuning**, self-hosting opens up new possibilitiesâ€”along with a fair share of challenges.

We begin by examining *why* teams choose to self-host, comparing managed platforms like OpenAI with DIY solutions. From there, we dive into **hardware selection**, **cloud platform setup**, and **open-source model deployments**. Weâ€™ll walk through the end-to-end process of deploying your own LLMâ€”from model selection to inference endpointâ€”then move into fine-tuning techniques and advanced performance optimizations.

If you're building a chatbot product that needs **full control**, **enterprise compliance**, or **custom behavior**, this part will teach you the essential skills and tradeoffs of running models yourself.

### Chapters Summary

#### ðŸ”¹ Chapter 10: Introduction to Self-Hosted LLMs

Understand the **benefits and tradeoffs** of self-hosting. Learn when it's worth moving away from OpenAI or Claude to local or cloud-hosted open models. We'll cover **privacy**, **latency**, **cost**, and **customization** considerations, plus a breakdown of hardware options: GPU, TPU, and CPU setupsâ€”on-premise or in the cloud.

#### ðŸ”¹ Chapter 11: Hosting Models on Cloud Platforms

Explore step-by-step how to host models using **AWS SageMaker**, **Google Vertex AI**, and **Azure ML**. This chapter focuses on creating managed inference endpoints using pre-built or custom container images. You'll learn how to configure autoscaling, deploy multiple model versions, and monitor model health in production.

#### ðŸ”¹ Chapter 12: Open-Source Model Hosting (Local & Cloud)

Deploy Hugging Face Transformers and other open-source models like **LLaMA**, **Falcon**, and **Mistral** on your own infrastructure. Weâ€™ll cover both local setups and hosted endpoints (like Hugging Face Inference Endpoints), and walk through using **Docker + FastAPI + GPU acceleration** to expose your model to frontend chatbots.

#### ðŸ”¹ Chapter 13: Fine-Tuning Your Own Models

Learn how to customize pretrained models for your domain using **LoRA fine-tuning** and other transfer learning methods. This chapter walks through data preparation, using tools like **PEFT**, and running fine-tuning pipelines with PyTorch. Weâ€™ll also cover when to fine-tune vs. prompt-engineer.

#### ðŸ”¹ Chapter 14: Advanced Model Optimization Techniques

Reduce model size and inference time using **quantization**, **distillation**, **pruning**, and more. Dive into **ONNX Runtime**, **TensorRT**, **vLLM**, and **llama.cpp** for efficient deployment. This is essential reading if you want real-time responses with limited compute.
